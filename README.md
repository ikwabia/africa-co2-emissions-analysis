# AFRICA CO₂ EMISSIONS ANALYSIS

## Overview

Africa is often central to global climate discussions, yet its actual contribution to global CO₂ emissions is frequently misunderstood. This project provides a data-driven, visual analysis of territorial CO₂ emissions across African countries, highlighting regional disparities and global context using the most recent available data.

This project was designed as a portfolio piece for climate tech, sustainability, ESG, and data-driven roles.

## Objectives

Analyze country-level CO₂ emissions across Africa

Visualize emission distribution using geospatial mapping

Provide evidence-based insights to support climate equity discussions

Communicate complex climate data clearly for non-technical audiences

## Data Sources

Primary dataset: Our World in Data (OWID) – CO₂ Emissions Dataset

Year: 2024 (latest available)

Metrics used:

Territorial CO₂ emissions (fossil fuels + cement)

Geographic boundaries: Natural Earth

Data source: https://github.com/owid/co2-data

## Methodology

Extracted country-level CO₂ emissions data from OWID

Filtered African countries using ISO country codes

Selected the most recent year with complete data (2024)

Merged emissions data with Natural Earth geographic boundaries

Generated a choropleth map to visualize the spatial distribution of emissions

## Key Visualization

Africa CO₂ emissions by country (2024)
Territorial CO₂ emissions from fossil fuels and cement production.

(See attached choropleth map visualization)

## Key Insights

Africa contributes a small share of global CO₂ emissions, despite rapid population growth

Emissions are highly concentrated in a small number of countries

Many African countries have very low absolute emissions, reinforcing climate equity considerations

Visualizing emissions spatially helps move climate discussions from perception to evidence
